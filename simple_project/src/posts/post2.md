## Rome Pizza

**Each Markdown file is parsed into a** node of type MarkdownRemark.

All frontmatter fields are converted into GraphQL fields through inference.

This plugin adds additional fields to the MarkdownRemark GraphQL type including html, 
excerpt, headings, etc. Other Gatsby plugins can also add additional fields.
